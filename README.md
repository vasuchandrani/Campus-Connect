# 🎓 CampusConnect

**CampusConnect** is a unified platform designed for colleges to streamline communication, enhance student engagement, and expand academic opportunities.

This creates an ecosystem where information, opportunities, and academic achievements are centralized and effortlessly accessible.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Most colleges rely on scattered emails, outdated notice boards, and unorganized communication channels. Students miss announcements, clubs struggle to maintain engagement, and academic contributions from students often go unnoticed. Additionally, colleges lack a structured platform to showcase research work or publish campus news consistently.

- 📰 A university digital newspaper, managed by approved student journalists, delivering daily campus updates.

- 📬 Clubs to publish targeted announcements.
- 📝 Easy event registrations with pre-filled details.
